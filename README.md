# Mina zkApp: Message Board

Build a smart contract that allows users to publish messages semi-anonymously. 

This contract will allow a specific set of users to create new messages but will not disclose which user within the set has done so. With this way, people can leverage one aspect of their identity without revealing exactly who they are. So, for example, a DAO member could make credible statements on behalf of their DAO without revealing their specific individual identity.

This template uses TypeScript.
